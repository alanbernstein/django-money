* workflow

much of this is not done yet

** steps to go from PDF statements -> auto tagged transactions
1. pm download_statements   # TODO
2. pm parse_pdf_statements  # includes the 'populate' and 'normalize' steps (should also include assign_merchants_auto())
3. pm manage_transactions -a account-slug --auto-add-merchants
   TODO: if no merchant match, but exact description match, AND previous transaction has tags, then create merchant


** manually manage merchants and tags
pm manage_transactions -a account-slug --assign-interactive  # follow the displayed help
*** utility functions:
- search(search_string) - show all transactions and merchants matching some pattern
- add_merchant_pattern(merchant_id, pattern) - for when an existing merchant doesnt get all transactions
- add_merchant(name, pattern, tag_list)
- add_tx_tags(tids, tag_list)

*** data cleaning
pm fix_year_boundary_dates -a account-slug

** reporting
pm manage_merchants --describe
pm manage_transactions --describe

** set up new users/accounts/data
pm initialize
pm initialize -a account-slug --tags --filename <path>


* code organization
idea: if the function's core purpose is to manipulate:
 transactions - put in transactions.py
 merchants - put in merchants.py
 statements - put in statements.py

parsers go in parsers/*

** apps
*** accounts
main responsibilities:
- download account statement pdf/csv files
- rename statement files
- parse statement files to db
- handle automatic and manual tagging of merchants/transactions

*** bills
- download bill statements
- rename bill statements
- parse bill statements
actually, this sounds very repetitive - maybe just put this in accounts...

*** budget
looking forward...


* interface todo
tables should be sortable

** consuming statements
remove duplicate transactions
re-parse statements and re-add missing transactions, without duplicating
