TODO: view tag breakdown, but also view subtag breakdown
- that is, i should be able to view something like a chart of rent/bills/food/entertainment/...
- but also, a chart of all transactions matching a single tag, split up by other tags they also have. eg:
  - food: groceries/meal/date
  - travel: airfare/lodging/food
- etc

IDEA: label some tags as "top-level", that is, tags in that set will never be used together
1) bills
2) food
3) transportation
IDEA: figure out this set automatically

options for decent charts:

- django-nvd3
  - depends on python-nvd3, nvd3, bower - might be the best looking/most mature (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-nvd3)
